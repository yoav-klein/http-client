- Adding struct http_handle
- Adding function init_connection that opens the socket,
  sends the request to the server, reads the headers, populates
  a http_handle struct and returns it.
  
  This is before creating a function "get_chunk" that the user can call

----
- get_response_status - takes http_response* instead of char*
- http_req - became static
- close_connection - instead of http_handle_free
    frees the memory and closes the socket
